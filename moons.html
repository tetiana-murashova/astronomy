            <h2>The Moon</h2>
            <p>
                Earth's Moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot. The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate.
                It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth. Our moon is the fifth largest of the 190+ moons orbiting planets in our solar
                system.

            <p><span>Size and Distance</span><br> With a radius of 1,079.6 miles (1,737.5 kilometers), the Moon is less than a third the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, the Moon would be about as big as a coffee bean. The Moon is farther
                away from Earth than most people realize. The Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers) away. That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in between Earth and the Moon. The Moon is slowly moving away from Earth, getting
                about an inch farther away each year. <br><br><span>Water on the Moon</span><br> During the initial exploration of the moon, and the analysis of all the returned samples from the Apollo and the Luna missions, we thought that the surface
                of the moon was dry. The first definitive discovery of water was made in 2008 by the Indian mission Chandrayaan-1, which detected hydroxyl molecules spread across the lunar surface and concentrated at the poles. Missions usch as Lunar
                Prospector, LCROSS, and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, have not only shown that the surface of the Moon has a global hydration, but there are actually high concentrations of ice water in the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar poles.<br><br><span>Potential for Life</span><br>                The many missions that have explored the Moon have found no evidence to suggest it has its own living things. However, the Moon could be the site of future colonization by humans. The discovery the Moon harbors water ice, and that the
                highest concentrations occur within darkened craters at the poles, makes the Moon a little more hospitable for future human colonists. </p>

                <p> Mars' moons are among the smallest in the solar system. Phobos is a bit larger than Deimos, and orbits only 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers) above the Martian surface. No known moon orbits closer to its planet. It whips around Mars three
                    times a day, while the more distant Deimos takes 30 hours for each orbit. Like Earth's Moon, Phobos and Deimos always present the same face to their planet. Both are lumpy, heavily-cratered and covered in dust and loose rocks. They
                    are among the darker objects in the solar system. The moons appear to be made of carbon-rich rock mixed with ice and may be captured asteroids. </p>

                    Jupiter has 53 named moons and another 26 awaiting official names. Combined, scientists now think Jupiter has 79 moons. There are many interesting moons orbiting the planet, but the ones of most scientific interest are the first four moons discovered
                    beyond Earth—the Galilean satellites. The planet Jupiter's four largest moons are called the Galilean satellites after Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, who first observed them in 1610. The German astronomer Simon Marius claimed
                    to have seen the moons around the same time, but he did not publish his observations and so Galileo is given the credit for their discovery. These large moons, named Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, are each distinctive worlds.</p>

                <p> The Voyager and Pioneer flybys of the 1970s and 1980s provided rough sketches of Saturn’s moons. But during its many years in Saturn orbit, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft discovered previously unknown moons, solved mysteries about known ones,
                    studied their interactions with the rings and uncovered new mysteries—including the discovery on an ocean moon with potential ingredients for life—that will engage a whole new generation of space scientists.​ While the larger moons
                    are spherical, others are shaped like a sweet potato (Prometheus), a regular potato (Pandora), a meatball (Janus), and even a sponge (Hyperion). Some have a gnarled, irregular shape and texture like a dirty ice-ball (Epimetheus). </p>

                <p> “Sweet Moon," William Shakespeare wrote in "A Midsummer Night's Dream," "I thank thee for thy sunny beams; I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright." Centuries later, the moons of Uranus pay homage to the famous playwright. While
                    most of the satellites orbiting other planets take their names from various mythologies, Uranus' moons are unique in being named for Shakespearean characters, along with a couple of the moons being named for characters from the works
                    of Alexander Pope.</p>

                <p> We don't know with what beverage William Lassell may have celebrated his discovery of Neptune's moon, Triton, but beer made it possible. Lassell was one of 19th century England's grand amateur astronomers, using the fortune he made in
                    the brewery business to finance his telescopes. He spotted Triton on Oct. 10, 1846―just 17 days after a Berlin observatory discovered Neptune. Scientists using powerful telescopes and spacecraft have since discovered a total of 14
                    moons orbiting this distant, giant world.</p>
